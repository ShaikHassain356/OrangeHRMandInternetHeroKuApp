if we want to work on API server which will send response data in the form of JSON and XML we first isntall the
node JS and then respective packages using npm commands in cmd

for JSON
npm install -g json-server run in cmd to download related packages

copy the JSON data in notepad and save the file as filename.json
if we want to run the above file go to source folder and cmd
run this cmd json-server filename.json  this will provide one local host url http://localhost:3000/store and we can
work on that

for XML
npm install -g http-server  run in cmd to download related packages

copy the XML data in notepad and save the file as filename.xml
if we want to run the above file go to source folder and cmd
run this cmd http-server -p 3000
then we cas use this ul in browser  http://localhost:3000/agents.xml

for starting spring and to upload file through API
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage -- This will repackage the JAR correctly with all dependencies.
java -jar target/OrangeHRM-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
we need to use this below curl
curl -X POST -F "file=@/path/to/jan7.xlsx" -F "directory=uploads" http://localhost:8080/api/upload

curl to upload single file
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/upload-single" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.txt" \
  -F "directory=uploads"

curl to upload multiple files
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/upload-multiple" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "files=@/path/to/your/file1.txt" \
  -F "files=@/path/to/your/file2.txt" \
  -F "directory=uploads"
